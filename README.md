# SemitoneGame
This is a basic Python Semitone Guesser Game

## Instructions
run the main.py with 'python main.py'
Follow the menu, it will guide you.


## Notes
This was a quick small piece of code. The idea was that it 
should not be overly complicated. I did not build classes and objects etc and 
just kept it a simple python coded game.

Thank you for checking it out!
